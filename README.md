# rubik-color-recognition

> A simple demo for class e-me system

The code is only for image processing, GUI and machanic operating parts are created by my parterner Siyi Liu using unity

This program reads image file named "Screenshot_.png" then split nine blocks and generate a json file to give out the colors of each block by numbers in the table below.

This python code can only run properly in specific circumstances, or the RGB data will differ from those in train.txt.

`Ctrl+C` to kill the program, for now.

The color-number corresponding relation table is shown below.
|num|color|
|---|-----|
|1|blue|
|2|green|
|3|red|
|4|orange|
|5|white|
|6|yellow|
