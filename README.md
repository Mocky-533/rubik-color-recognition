# rubik-color-recognition

> A simple demo for class e-me system

The code is only for image processing, GUI and machanic operating parts are created by my parterner Siyi Liu using unity

This python code can only run properly in specific circumstances, or the RGB data will differ from those in train.txt.

The color-number corresponding relation is shown below.
|num|color|
|---|-----|
|1|blue|
|2|green|
|3|red|
|4|orange|
